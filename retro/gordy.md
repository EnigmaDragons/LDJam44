# Gordy Keene - Retrospective Notes

1) What went well?

* Final game looks, sounds and plays awesome
* MVP was delivered in first day
* Team communicated well
* I felt that the initial game brainstorming lead to some great ideas, even though many of them were not full games.

2) What didn't go well?

* Some team members were not fully setup on the tools by the time the jam started.
* Felt a lot of pressure to brainstorm up something of value, I'm sure it was self-inflicted, as everyone was very kind and polite.
* Git & Unity meta files don't play well together
* It might have helped if the content producers were more comfortable directly committing complete elements into the Unity project. But I find Unity to be much less intuitive than Visual Studio (partially related to my own lack of familiarity), so I get their hesitancy.

3) What lessons can we take moving forward?

* Perhaps have a trial run where we get all the team members together and make sure they can use the tools (git, Zube, Unity) and work through any configuration issues before the jam begins.
* Since we knew the "short-list" (20 or so?) of possible topics, we could have done a mini brainstorming ahead of time. Honestly, had I envisioned how things were going to turn out, I could have done this on my own.

4) What was your personal favorite part of the jam?

* As in previous jams, its great to watch an entire game come together out of nothing.

5) What is your favorite thing in the game?

* The randomness and variety of banned products, very creative!
