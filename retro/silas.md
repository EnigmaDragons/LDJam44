Silas Reinagel - Retrospective Notes

## 1) What went well?

- We made it through 4 iterations in 3 days, incrementally delivering huge improvements with each!
- Unity is a genuinely great engine to work with!
- Killer awesome team members, especially ZavixDragon, Shaddo, and Ezra3, Gordy Keene!

## 2) What didn't go well?

- One programmer abandoned the jam
- We didn't have end up with any original music in the game
- Some animations were hard to change and tweak
- Initialization in various scenes was an afterthought, instead of a core part of the design

## 3) What lessons can we take moving forward?

- Number of iterations is a huge factor in how evolved and polished the game will be
- Try to build a bigger team, so that when 1-2 people fall off, we still have plenty of jammers
- Explicitly design state transfer and scene initialization in the first iteration

## 4) What was your personal favorite part of the jam?

- Slowly seeing the greybox ship and space station turn into a full world of asteroids, debris, dangerous enemies and a gorgeous main ship

## 5) What is your favorite thing in the game?

- I love the smooth shiny look that the bloom adds
- I love the humor of the product concepts and reasons
